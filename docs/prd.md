# Brownfield Enhancement PRD: Real-Time Solana Stream Processor

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

This PRD outlines the requirements for a significant enhancement: building a new, production-ready Rust application on top of the existing `yellowstone-vixen` library. The goal is to process real-time Solana data streams, filter them, and output them to MongoDB and a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream.

### 1.1. Existing Project Overview

#### 1.1.1. Analysis Source
This PRD is based on a fresh analysis of the `yellowstone-vixen` library, the output of which is captured in the `docs/yellowstone-vixen-architecture.md` document.

#### 1.1.2. Current Project State
The existing project, `yellowstone-vixen`, is a modular, high-performance Rust library (a parser toolkit) for building data processing pipelines for Solana blockchain data. Its primary purpose is to provide a framework with configurable sources, parsers, and handlers to enable developers to subscribe to, decode, and process on-chain data without having to build the low-level infrastructure from scratch.

### 1.2. Available Documentation Analysis

Using the existing project analysis from the `document-project` output, the following documentation is available and has been reviewed:

- [x] Tech Stack Documentation
- [x] Source Tree/Architecture
- [x] API Documentation (in the form of public traits and structs)
- [x] Technical Debt Documentation (as part of the brownfield analysis)

### 1.3. Enhancement Scope Definition

#### 1.3.1. Enhancement Type
- [x] New Feature Addition
- [ ] Major Feature Modification
- [x] Integration with New Systems (MongoDB, SSE Clients)
- [ ] Performance/Scalability Improvements
- [ ] UI/UX Overhaul
- [ ] Technology Stack Upgrade
- [ ] Bug Fix and Stability Improvements

#### 1.3.2. Enhancement Description
This project involves creating a new, standalone Rust application that uses the `yellowstone-vixen` library as a dependency. The application will configure a data pipeline to parse data from multiple Solana programs, implement a chain of custom handlers to filter this data to essential fields, and then simultaneously stream it via SSE and store it in a MongoDB database.

#### 1.3.3. Impact Assessment
- [x] Minimal Impact (isolated additions)
- [ ] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
- [ ] Significant Impact (substantial new code that relies heavily on the existing library)
- [ ] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### 1.4. Goals and Background Context

#### 1.4.1. Goals
- Build a real-time data processor without modifying the core `yellowstone-vixen` library.
- Create custom handlers for filtering, SSE streaming, and MongoDB storage.
- Focus data processing on essential trading and account balance information.
- Ensure database operations are asynchronous and do not block real-time streaming.
- Integrate Prometheus metrics for production-grade monitoring.

#### 1.4.2. Background Context
The `yellowstone-vixen` framework provides robust core capabilities for data ingestion and parsing. This project aims to leverage that foundation to build a specific, value-added application. Instead of building a generic tool, this effort is focused on a common use case: extracting high-value, simplified trading data from the firehose of Solana transactions and making it immediately available for consumption by other services, such as a Go-based trading client.

## 2. Requirements

These requirements are based on the analysis of the existing `yellowstone-vixen` library and the goals of the new application.

### 2.1. Functional Requirements
- **FR1: Framework Integration**: The application MUST be built upon the existing `yellowstone-vixen` `Pipeline` and `Handler` interfaces without any modification to the library's source code.
- **FR2: Custom Handler Development**: The application MUST implement one unified handler per program for both Account and Instruction data, using composition of custom handler trait if necessary, to execute all required tasks below in sequence without having to chain handlers:
    - Filtering parsed data to essential fields
    - Streaming filtered data via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    - Persisting filtered data to MongoDB.
- **FR3: Data Source Integration**: The application MUST support connecting to both Yellowstone gRPC (primary) and standard Solana RPC (secondary) data sources using the library's existing source patterns.
- **FR4: Program Parsing**: The application MUST use the library's existing parsers for SPL Token, Pump.fun, Boop.fun, and Moonshot programs.
- **FR5: Data Filtering & Simplification**: The application MUST filter and transform parsed data into simplified data structures containing only essential fields (`token_mint`, `transaction_signature`, `instruction_type`, `data`, timestamps).
- **FR6: Database Storage**: The application MUST store simplified data in MongoDB in program-specific collections (`{program}.accounts`, `{program}.instructions`). All database writes MUST be asynchronous and non-blocking to the main processing pipeline.
- **FR7: Real-Time Streaming**: The application MUST expose a web server with endpoints for health (`/health`), metrics (`/metrics`), and SSE streaming (`/events/stream`), providing immediate access to filtered data.
- **FR8: Go Client Boilerplate**: A separate, companion Go project MUST be provided to demonstrate consumption of the SSE stream.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1: Performance Throughput**: The application MUST sustain processing of at least 5,000 messages per second on the target hardware (Mac Intel i7).
- **NFR2: Performance Latency**: End-to-end latency for SSE streaming must be under 10ms, and under 200ms for database persistence.
- **NFR3: Resource Consumption**: The application's memory usage should remain under 2GB of RAM under normal load.
- **NFR4: Development Environment**: The primary development and testing environment will be a Mac Intel i7 with 16GB RAM, Rust 1.70+, Go 1.21+, and MongoDB 6.0+.

### 2.3. Compatibility Requirements
- **CR1: Library Immutability**: There must be zero modifications to the `yellowstone-vixen` library's codebase. It must be treated as an external, third-party dependency.
- **CR2: Interface Adherence**: The custom handlers MUST strictly adhere to the `Handler` trait definition provided in `yellowstone-vixen-runtime`.
- **CR3: Proto Compliance**: The application MUST use the compiled Protobuf definitions provided by the `yellowstone-vixen` parser crates without alteration.

## 3. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 3.1. Existing Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Rust (1.70+)
- **Frameworks**: `yellowstone-vixen` (core, runtime, parsers), `tokio`
- **Database**: N/A (The library itself is database-agnostic)
- **Infrastructure**: N/A
- **External Dependencies**: `yellowstone-grpc-client`, `solana-rpc-client`, `serde`, `prost`

### 3.2. Integration Approach
- **Database Integration Strategy**: A new MongoDB dependency will be added to the custom application. A dedicated `MongoHandler` will use the official Rust driver for MongoDB to perform asynchronous `insert` operations, spawned onto a separate Tokio task to prevent blocking.
- **API Integration Strategy**: A new web server (e.g., using `axum` or `actix-web`) will be added to the custom application. An `SseHandler` will be responsible for pushing filtered data to connected clients.
- **Frontend Integration Strategy**: Not applicable for the Rust application. A separate Go client will be developed to consume the SSE stream.
- **Testing Integration Strategy**: The custom application will have its own suite of unit and integration tests. Integration tests will mock the `Message` input to the handler chain and verify outputs to mock SSE clients and an in-memory MongoDB instance.

### 3.3. Code Organization and Standards
- **File Structure Approach**: The new `solana-stream-processor` project will follow the structure outlined in the initial PRD, with distinct modules for `handlers`, `models`, `config`, and `metrics`.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow standard Rust naming conventions (`PascalCase` for types, `snake_case` for functions and variables).
- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to `clippy` lints and standard Rust best practices.
- **Documentation Standards**: All public functions and structs in the new application must have doc comments.

### 3.4. Deployment and Operations
- **Build Process Integration**: The new application will be a standard Cargo binary project.
- **Deployment Strategy**: For local development, the application will be run directly using `cargo run`. Monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana) will be managed via `docker-compose`.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: The application will expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus and use the `tracing` crate for structured logging, consistent with the `yellowstone-vixen` library.
- **Configuration Management**: The application will use a `config.toml` file for its own settings (MongoDB URI, server port) and will rely on the Vixen-standard configuration for data source settings.

### 3.5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**:
    - **Concurrent Processing**: Race conditions or deadlocks between SSE and DB operations. **Mitigation**: Ensure handlers are stateless or use appropriate locking, and ensure all I/O is fully non-blocking.
- **Deployment Risks**:
    - **Local Performance**: Resource constraints on the target Mac Intel i7. **Mitigation**: Implement backpressure handling in the SSE stream and connection pooling for MongoDB.
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging within each handler.
    - Develop thorough integration tests for the entire handler chain.
    - Use circuit breakers for external dependencies like the database.

## 4. Epic and Story Structure

### 4.1. Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: This enhancement will be structured as a single, comprehensive epic. This is because the work represents the creation of one cohesive application, where all components are tightly interdependent and deliver value as a whole, grounded in the existing `yellowstone-vixen` library.

---

## 5. Epic 1: Real-Time Solana Stream Processor Implementation

**Epic Goal**: To develop a standalone Rust application that leverages the `yellowstone-vixen` library to create a real-time, filtered, and multi-output stream of Solana program data.

**Integration Requirements**: The final application must successfully integrate with the `yellowstone-vixen` runtime, parsers, and core types as external dependencies. It must also integrate with MongoDB for storage and expose an SSE stream for real-time clients.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Framework Integration
As a developer, I want to set up a new Rust project that correctly integrates the `yellowstone-vixen` library and can run a basic data processing pipeline, so that I have a foundation for building custom logic.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A new Cargo binary project `solana-stream-processor` is created.
2. `Cargo.toml` includes all necessary `yellowstone-vixen` crates (`runtime`, `core`, `parser`, `pumpfun-parser`, etc.) as path dependencies.
3. A basic `main.rs` can initialize the `RuntimeBuilder`, add a parser, attach a simple logging handler, and run the pipeline successfully.
4. The application can connect to a configured data source (e.g., a public Solana RPC) and log raw received messages.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The application compiles successfully against the `yellowstone-vixen` library crates.
- **IV2**: The runtime successfully connects to the gRPC/RPC endpoint defined in the configuration.
- **IV3**: No performance impact is expected at this stage.

### Story 1.2: Data Filtering and Simplification Handler
As a developer, I want to implement a custom `FilterHandler` that intercepts parsed program data, extracts a predefined set of essential fields, and passes a simplified data model to the next stage, so that downstream consumers only receive relevant information.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A `src/handlers/filter_handler.rs` module is created with a `FilterHandler` struct.
3. The handler can successfully receive `Message::Instruction` and extract fields like `token_mint`, `transaction_signature`, etc.
4. A simplified `EssentialData` struct is defined in `src/models.rs`.
5. The handler transforms the incoming instruction into `EssentialData` and returns it to handled by other handlers, all as a part of our unified handler interface.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The `FilterHandler` correctly returns `EssentialData`.
- **IV2**: The handler correctly processes `InstructionUpdate` structs from multiple parsers (e.g., Pump.fun and SPL Token).
- **IV3**: The filtering logic adds minimal latency (<1ms) to the processing pipeline.

### Story 1.3: Real-Time SSE Streaming Handler
As a developer, I want to implement an `SseHandler` and a web server that streams the simplified data received from the `FilterHandler` to connected clients over Server-Sent Events, so that data is available in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A web server (`axum` or `actix-web`) is added to the project.
2. The server exposes a `/events/stream` endpoint that supports SSE.
3. An `SseHandler` is implemented that receives `EssentialData` and broadcasts it to all connected SSE clients.
4. The SSE push operation is non-blocking.
5. A simple HTML/JS client or `curl` can connect to the stream and receive data.
6. `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints are also exposed.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The `SseHandler` correctly handles data received from `FilterHandler`.
- **IV2**: The SSE stream remains stable and does not crash under high message volume.
- **IV3**: The SSE handler does not introduce significant backpressure into the Vixen pipeline.

### Story 1.4: Asynchronous MongoDB Storage Handler
As a developer, I want to implement a `MongoHandler` that asynchronously writes the simplified data to a MongoDB database, so that all processed data is persisted for historical analysis.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The `mongodb` Rust driver is added as a dependency.
2. A `MongoHandler` is implemented that receives `EssentialData`.
3. Upon receiving data, the handler spawns a new Tokio task to perform the database `insert_one` operation.
4. The `handle` function returns immediately and does not wait for the database write to complete.
5. Data is correctly stored in collections named after the program (e.g., `pumpfun.instructions`).
6. Database connection errors are logged but do not crash the application.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The `MongoHandler` receives data correctly.
- **IV2**: The application's main processing loop is not blocked by slow database writes.
- **IV3**: The application can sustain the target throughput (5000+ msg/sec) while database writes are occurring in the background.

### Story 1.5: Go Client Boilerplate
As a developer, I want a boilerplate Go client that can connect to the SSE stream and process incoming messages, so that I have a template for building downstream applications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A new Go project is created in a separate directory.
2. The Go client can connect to the `/events/stream` endpoint.
3. It includes Go structs that match the JSON structure of the `EssentialData` from the Rust application.
4. The client can parse incoming SSE messages into these structs.
5. The client includes basic reconnection logic in case the stream is interrupted.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The Go client successfully receives and deserializes data streamed from the Rust application.
- **IV2**: The data integrity is maintained between the Rust producer and Go consumer.
- **IV3**: N/A.

### Story 1.6: Monitoring and Observability
As a developer, I want to integrate custom Prometheus metrics for application-level monitoring and set up a local Grafana dashboard, so that I can observe the performance and health of the stream processor.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Custom Prometheus metrics (`stream_messages_processed_total`, `processing_latency_seconds`, etc.) are defined and implemented.
2. These metrics are exposed via the `/metrics` endpoint.
3. A `docker-compose.yaml` file is created to run local instances of Prometheus and Grafana.
4. Prometheus is configured to scrape the application's `/metrics` endpoint.
5. A basic Grafana dashboard is provisioned to visualize the custom metrics and key metrics from the `yellowstone-vixen` library.

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: The custom metrics are correctly incremented by the handlers.
- **IV2**: Prometheus can successfully scrape the metrics endpoint.
- **IV3**: The Grafana dashboard correctly displays real-time data from Prometheus.
